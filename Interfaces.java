// Interfaces in Java :
//  -->  Just like a class in java is a collection of the related methods, an interface in java is a "collection of abstract methods".
//  -->  The interface is one more way to achieve abstraction in Java.
//  -->  An interface may also contain constants, default methods, and static methods.

//  -->  All the methods inside an interface must have empty bodies except default methods and static methods.
//  -->  We use the interface keyword to declare an interface.
//  -->  There is no need to write abstract keyword before declaring methods in an interface because an interface is implicitly abstract.
//  -->  An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)
//  -->  In order to implement an interface, java requires a class to use the "implements" keyword.

// (aj-trick) --> same = "extends" ; different = "interfece"
// multiple class ko use karke ek NEW class ko nahi janam(inheritance) de sakte BUT 
// BUT multiple inheritance ka use karke ek NEW class ko janam de sakte hai
